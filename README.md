dune-xt is an eXTensions module for [DUNE](https://www.dune-project.org),
which is often used in the context of
the discretization module [dune-gdt](https://github.com/dune-community/dune-gdt).

There is a paper describing some of the concepts behind this extension. While
already dated (in particular, the four modules dune-xt-common, dune-xt-grid, dune-xt-la and dune-xt-functions have been merged into the single dune-xt module),
most ideas still apply:

```

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
[dune-xt-super](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-xt-super), experienced
DUNE users may go ahead.
