dune-gdt is a [DUNE](http://www.dune-project.org/) module which provides a generic
discretization toolbox for grid-based numerical methods. It contains building blocks - like
local operators, local evaluations, local assemblers - for discretization methods and suitable
discrete function spaces.

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
[dune-gdt-super](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-gdt-super). Experienced DUNE users
may go ahead. As usual, you will have to use
[dunecontrol](https://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation/), working examples are located
in 'dune/gdt/test/'...

If you want to start hacking go ahead and

or [gitlab](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-gdt)!

dune-xt is an eXTensions module for [DUNE](https://www.dune-project.org),
which is often used in the context of
the discretization module [dune-gdt](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-gdt).

There is a paper describing some of the concepts behind this extension. While
already dated (in particular, the four modules dune-xt-common, dune-xt-grid, dune-xt-la and dune-xt-functions have been merged into the single dune-xt module),
most ideas still apply:

```

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
[dune-xt-super](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-xt-super), experienced
DUNE users may go ahead.
